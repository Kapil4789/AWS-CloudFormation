# A YAML format primarily uses three node types:
# 
# 1. document
# 2. scalar values
# 3. sequence values
# 4. mapping values (also called hash values)
# 
# The YAML format is designed to be human-readable and human-editable.
# 
# The document node represents the entire YAML document, which can contain multiple scalar values, sequence values, and mapping values.
# 
# The scalar values represent string, integer, float, boolean, and null values.
# 
# The sequence values represent ordered lists of values, which can be of any type (scalar, sequence, or mapping).
# 
# The mapping values represent unordered key-value pairs, where the keys are strings and the values can be of any type (scalar, sequence, or mapping).
# 
# The YAML format is designed to be compatible with other programming languages, including Python, Java, and C#. It is also designed to be easily readable and editable, making it a popular choice for configuration files and data interchange.

# scalar values
string: "Hello, World!"
integer: 42
float: 3.14
boolean: true
null: null

# sequence values
sequence:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

# mapping values
mapping:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  key3: value3

Maps/Dictionaries (YAML calls it mapping)
---
# Maps/Dictionaries (YAML calls it mapping)
The content of a mapping node is an unordered set of key/value node pairs, with the restriction that each of the keys is unique. YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes.
--- 
# Example of a mapping node in YAML
mapping:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  key3: value3

Arrays/Lists (YAML calls them sequences)
---
# Arrays/Lists (YAML calls them sequences)
The content of a sequence node is an ordered list of nodes. YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes.

The content of a sequence node is an ordered series of zero or more nodes. In particular, a sequence may contain the same node more than once. It could even contain itself.
--- 
# Example of a sequence node in YAML
sequence:
  - item1
  - item2
  - item3

Literals (Strings, numbers, boolean, etc.)
---
# Literals (Strings, numbers, boolean, etc.)
The content of a scalar node is an opaque datum that can be presented as a series of zero or more Unicode characters.

YAML provides a few literal node types for representing scalar values. These are:
- string
- integer
- float
- boolean
- null
